## **Introduction**

In this lesson, we'll delve into various business use cases where chatbots and Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged to enhance efficiency, improve customer interactions, and streamline operations. Understanding these applications will provide a clear direction for developing more specialized and impactful chatbot solutions.

## **Use Cases**

### **1. Customer Support**

Automating responses to common customer inquiries, providing 24/7 support, and reducing the workload on human agents.

### **2. Sales Assistance**

Guiding customers through product selections, upselling, and providing personalized recommendations to boost sales.

### **3. Internal Knowledge Base**

Assisting employees with company policies, procedures, and accessing relevant information quickly.

### **4. Data Analysis**

Summarizing and interpreting business data, generating reports, and providing insights based on data analysis.

### **5. Scheduling and Reminders**

Managing calendars, scheduling meetings, and sending reminders to ensure timely actions.

## **Code Implementation**

We'll demonstrate how to customize the existing chatbot for the **Customer Support** use case.

### **Customizing the Chatbot for Customer Support**

Refer to the following code snippets to set up a specialized customer support chatbot.

1. **Backend Enhancements:**
   - Update `langchain_model.py` to set up a customer support-specific chatbot.
   - Create a new API endpoint in `chatbot.py` for customer support interactions.

2. **Frontend Enhancements:**
   - Add a new service function to interact with the customer support endpoint.
   - Develop a new React component for the customer support chatbot interface.
   - Integrate the new component into the main application.

```bash
RUN CODE:
VS Code create a spilt terminal
Terminal left client: \Enterprise-LLM-RAG\lessons\02-usecases\code\client>npm start
Terminal right server: (venv)\Enterprise=LLM-RAG\lessons\02-usecases\code\server>uvicorn main:app --reload 
```
